My journey of meditation started two years ago, when I was a freshmen in collage. I read a book named “the mindful way through depression” by Zindel Segal. I started trying MBSR (Mindfulness-based stress reduction),it brings me life-transforming impacts, which  can be called enlightenment, and thus my journey on meditation starts.

I did this follow a online course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/buddhist-meditation/home/welcome">Tibetan Buddhist Meditation and the Modern World</a>. Tibetan Buddhism is quite close to primitive India Buddhism. It emphasizes Buddhism such as unavoidable suffering and  impermanence, and the first step to reduce suffering is to accept the fact that we are all suffering. For me, it’s a little difficult to fully engage in because it’s hard to understand these criteria without a Buddhism background knowledge.
